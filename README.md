<p id="description">Fully hackable versatile neural network library suitable for beginners and experts alike. Written in C++. Full project coming soon...</p>

  
  
<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   FULLY HACKABLE - Gone are the days of sitting for hours on end trying to decipher the non essential methods in larger libraries! Everything here is straightforward and commented.
*   LIGHTWEIGHT - This library was built to be lightweight (not taking up 400MB space on your system). Use it for mobile AI development and more!
*   INTUITIVE - Large contemporary AI libraries take too long to effectively begin using. Get to building with a simple syntax and extensive documentation near immediately!
*   VERSATILE - Got a C++ compiler? That's literally all you need to use this! Compile everywhere!
*   IT'S IN C++ - Need I say more? Go back to making your programs 20 times faster. Be free from the shackles of python libraries!
